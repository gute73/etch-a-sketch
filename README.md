# Mouse-a-Sketch

This project is browser-based variation on the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy.
The screen is a grid, and the user is able to "sketch" by dragging the mouse
across the screen and highlighting boxes on the grid.  The user is also able 
to select the number of boxes in the grid, which improves resolution and the
capacity for detail.
